# Réti Open Pooling Overview

## Protocol Overview

The minimum stake needed to receive node rewards is 30,000 ALGO, as decided in a general [governance vote](https://governance.algorand.foundation/governance-period-10/period-10-voting-session-1). You can run a node with less than 30,000 ALGO, but you won't be eligible to receive rewards, even if you propose a block. This is where pooling becomes helpful for users.

The Réti Open Pooling protocol facilitates the creation of staking pools that anyone can join or manage, not only broadening participation in Algorand's consensus mechanism but also encouraging a diverse array of validators. This inclusivity extends particularly to small developers and community projects, empowering them with the tools to establish their own staking pools and tap into new revenue streams. Notably, the protocol's open-source nature fosters a dynamic environment where customization and development are highly encouraged, ensuring adaptability and resilience against more centralized staking models.

At its core, Réti Open Pooling is built on a comprehensive open-source foundation, coming with smart contracts, backend infrastructure, and a basic and customizable front-end interface. The design allows validators significant flexibility in configuring staking pools to suit varied community needs—ranging from stake amount thresholds to reward mechanisms—while maintaining immutable core parameters for staker assurance. Moreover, the protocol's design promotes broad engagement by providing a basic UI for immediate use, alongside the potential for community-driven interface enhancements. Through this blend of accessibility and customization, Réti Open Pooling aims to democratize staking on the Algorand network, ensuring equitable participation and fostering a healthier, more decentralized ecosystem.

## Objectives

* **Increase Participation in Algorand Consensus:** Provide an option for permissionless staking pools. Users and validators can earn yield and protect the network by trustlessly pooling their stake together and participating in consensus, allowing small stakeholders to directly participate in consensus.
* **Enhance Overall Security with a Variety of Approaches:** It's likely that other companies will offer Liquid Staking products that can dangerously centralize stake, as seen in other ecosystems (LIDO on Ethereum). Open and permissionless staking pools offer a different approach, where anyone can run a validator / create a pool, and where anyone can participate in those pools. This should make it possible to diversify the stake onto far more nodes than if only proprietary solutions are offered.
* **Incentivizing Many Validators:** The proposed node incentives are going to drive users to stake their ALGO rather than lock-up in governance or defi. Ideally, there is an economic model that allows everyone to benefit from this, including small projects who want to offer staking. These smaller developers / communities can use this protocol to launch their own staking pools and pool with their already established communities. We see this being popular with the memecoin and NFT communities as it offers projects a reliable revenue stream.
